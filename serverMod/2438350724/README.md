# Combined-Status

Mod for all versions of Don't Starve and Don't Starve Together. It enhances the HUD to better show the player's stats and various information about the world, such as temperature, season, and moon phase. Also available on the Steam Workshop ([singleplayer](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=574636989), [multiplayer](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=376333686)) and the [Klei Forums](http://forums.kleientertainment.com/files/file/1136-combined-status/).

# Installation

If you have the game on Steam, it's easiest to subscribe to the mod there. Otherwise, download this and put the folder in the game's mods folder. Then you can enable and configure it on the in-game mods menu.

# Configuration Options

Option | Description
------ | -----------
**Temperature** | Whether to show the temperature of the player. Defaults to _Show_.
**Show World Temp** | Whether to show the temperature of the world. Defaults to _Hide_.
**Show Temp Badges** | Whether to show small images to indicate which temperature is which. Badges only get shown if this is set to _Show_ and both player and world temperatures are enabled. Defaults to _Show_.
**Temperature Unit** | Whether to use the game's internal units (default), or approximations of Fahrenheit or Celsius. In _Game Units_, the player freezes at 0 and overheats at 70, with warning occurring 5 away. In _Celsius_, the player freezes at 0 and overheats at 35, with warning occurring 2.5 degrees away. In _Fahrenheit_, the player freezes at 32 and overheats at 95, with warning occurring 4.5 degrees away.
**Show Waning** | Whether to show if the moon is waxing or waning by adding new icons. Defaults to _Show_. (The game normally only shows icons for one direction). In Don't Starve Together, this is now a feature of the main game, so the option doesn't do anything.
**Show Moon** | Whether to show the moon only at _Night_ (the game's default), during night and dusk (_Dusk_, the mod's default), or _Always_.
**Predict Full Moon** | Whether to predict the day of the next full moon, shown when hovering over the moon icon. Defaults to _Yes_.
**Flip Moon** | Whether to flip the moon phase icon to show it like it is in the Southern Hemisphere, instead of the default Northern Hemisphere. Defaults to _No_.
**Season Clock** | _Clock_, the default, shows a full clock of the seasons. _Compact_ shows a smaller badge with the season and day count, while _Micro_ shows an even smaller badge. _No_ disables the season clock entirely.
**Naughtiness** | Whether to show the naughtiness of the player. Doesn't work in Don't Starve Together (unless you have [Insight](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2189004162) installed), as  naughtiness is not available to clients. Defaults to _Show_.
**Log Meter** | Whether to show the log meter for Woodie when he is human. Only relevant to singleplayer, as Don't Starve Together always shows the log meter already. Defaults to _Always_.
**Cave Clock** | Whether to always show the clock in the caves. Only relevant to singleplayer Reign of Giants, as the data is not available in vanilla and the clock shows in Don't Starve Together. Defaults to _Show_.
**Stat Numbers** | Whether to show the sanity, hunger, and health numbers without having to mouse over the badges. Defaults to _Always_.
**Show Max Text** | Whether to show the "Max:" text when hovering over the sanity, hunger, and health badges to see their maximum values. Defaults to _Show_.
**HUD Scale** | Lets you adjust the size of the badges and clocks independently of the game's HUD scale. Defaults to _1_.
