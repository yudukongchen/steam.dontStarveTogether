### Automate gathering resources!

![Mod Overview](https://i.imgur.com/JQMCocU.png)

## Description
G10MM-3R is a drone version of Glommer. Design inspired by Drones from Slime Rancher.
It can:
- Pick up various inventory items (uncooked food and resources),
- Pick resources like Grass, Saplings, Berries, etc.

It will store all its items inside a modified Glommer Statue (dubbed "G10MM-3R Base").
It doesn't need any fuel - it will work until broken.

You can find its blueprint by mining the Glommer's Statue. In case you missed it, there's also 20% chance of it dropping from Dragonfly/Bee Queen. Also, 1% chance of getting it from hammered Broken Clockwork piles.
